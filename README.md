#  Competition Procedure

The main task of the competition is to detect a collision threat reliably. In this challenge, you will train your agents locally and then upload them to AIcrowd (via git) to be evaluated. 

**The following is a high level description of how this round works**

![](https://i.imgur.com/xzQkwKV.jpg)

1. **Sign up** to join the competition [on the AIcrowd website].(https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/airborne-object-tracking-challenge)
2. **Clone** this repo and start developing your submissions.
3. **Train** your models to detect objects and write inference code in `test.py`.
4. [**Submit**](#how-to-submit-a-model) your trained models to [AIcrowd Gitlab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com) for evaluation [(full instructions below)](#how-to-submit-a-model).  The automated evaluation setup will evaluate the submissions against the test dataset, to compute and report the metrics on the leaderboard of the competition.

# How to access and use dataset

The starter kit contains dataset exploration notebooks and helper functions to access the dataset.
You can check the instructions for the same here: üëâ [DATASET.md](/docs/DATASET.md).

# How to start participating

## Setup

1. **Add your SSH key** to AIcrowd GitLab

You can add your SSH Keys to your GitLab account by going to your profile settings [here](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/profile/keys). If you do not have SSH Keys, you will first need to [generate one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair).

2.  **Clone the repository**

    ```
    git clone git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:amazon-prime-air/airborne-detection-starter-kit.git
    ```

3. **Install** competition specific dependencies!
    ```
    cd airborne-detection-starter-kit
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run local exploration notebook** present in `data/dataset-playground.ipynb` using `jupyter notebook` command locally.


5. Try out random prediction codebase present in `test.py`.


## How do I specify my software runtime / dependencies ?

We accept submissions with custom runtime, so you don't need to worry about which libraries or framework to pick from.

The configuration files typically includes `requirements.txt` (pypi packages), `environment.yml` (conda environment), `apt.txt` (apt packages) or even your own `Dockerfile`.

You can check detailed information about the same in üëâ [RUNTIME.md](/docs/RUNTIME.md) file.

## What should my code structure be like ?

Please follow the example structure shared in the starter kit for the code structure.
The different files and directories have following meaning:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aicrowd.json           # Submission meta information like your username
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apt.txt                # Packages to be installed inside docker image
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data                   # Your local dataset copy, you don't need to upload it (read DATASET.md)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Python packages to be installed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test.py                # IMPORTANT: Your testing/inference phase code, must be derived from AirbornePredictor (example in test.py)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utility                # The utility scripts to provide smoother experience to you.
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker_build.sh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker_run.sh
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ environ.sh
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verify_or_download_data.sh
```

Finally, **you must specify an AIcrowd submission JSON in `aicrowd.json` to be scored!** 

The `aicrowd.json` of each submission should contain the following content:

```json
{
  "challenge_id": "airborne-detection-challenge",
  "authors": ["your-aicrowd-username"],
  "description": "sample description about your awesome agent",
  "license": "MIT",
  "gpu": true
}
```

This JSON is used to map your submission to the said challenge, so please remember to use the correct `challenge_id` as specified above.

Please specify if your code will use a GPU or not for the evaluation of your model. If you specify `true` for the GPU, GPU will be provided and used for the evaluation.

## How to make submission

üëâ [SUBMISSION.md](/docs/SUBMISSION.md)


**Best of Luck** :tada: :tada:

# Other Concepts

## Time constraints

You need to make sure that your model can predict airborne objects for each flight within 1000 second, otherwise the submission will be mark as failed. (_need revision on timeouts based on budget_)

## Local evaluation

You can also test end to end evaluation on your own systems. The scripts are available in `core/metrics` folder.
